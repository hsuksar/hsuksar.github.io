I just wanna say I_LOVE_YOU SALMA‚Ä¶. .. I always ask you ghna  bada questions, not because I just am curious, but bcz every question comes from inside my heart. i knw We are so far apart from each other, and I try so much to be with you. This is difficult, but i think nothing on earth can make me forget you.

<p> Although we've met very few times in person, I still truly LOVE you. I don't really know when I first started to love you. Maybe it started with sending daily texts at night, back and forth every day, ending with a "good night"   with a lot of feeling. Then, one day, I found myself loving you and couldn't stop that feeling. Just knowing you more and more each day, and seeing how you understood everything I did, I started to love you more and more. Every time you say "Hi," you brought a smile on my face.
Distance is and (I think) will be a problem for now, but if we look at it from a different point of view, we know this is the thing that prove our true love, nai to kaha itna busy duniya ma husain pase time che?!üòâ . It won't be long before we will smile with a tear of happiness together. I wait for the day we are together again, as I know you do too. I miss you and I love you with all my heart‚Ä¶..</p>
